Scrap the official writing pool in a few clicks.

## Instructions
### Option 1: Use the scrapped pdf files (Scraped on Jun 9, 2020).
I have formatted them and convert the file to pdfs. You may just download them.

### Option 2: Scrape your own.
If you need more customization, you may create your own version.
1. Click the badge above to `Open in Colab`
2. Follow the steps there (Repeated here):
    1. (Optional) Customize the simple settings
    2. Run every cell
    3. Download the generated `.txt` files


## Example
With the official website url: [Issue](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/analytical_writing/issue/pool) and [argument](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/analytical_writing/argument/pool),
![](https://i.imgur.com/iPMlEFX.png)

It generates a text file containing topics like this (Take the first one for example):
```
# 1 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities.

Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.
```
